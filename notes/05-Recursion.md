# Recursion
* Recursion is particularly important in Haskell.
* It's mainly about identifying and defining edge cases, then calling a function inside it's own declaration.
* Often, edge cases are empty lists, or 0.

Basically, recursion is exactly what you'd expect, and I'm very familiar already with recursion and had no problems with this chapter of the tutorial, so I'm not going to write notes for this. Sorry. I would suggest reading this chapter of the tutorial, it's a short one anyway.
